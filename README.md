# Zero_Ground
Zero Ground isn't just an arena. It's an abandoned zone.

After the catastrophe when countries destroyed each other in the "Silent War," only five underground arenas remain—built by robotic engineers to "filter out the survivors."

Players aren't soldiers. Not mercenaries.

They are the remnants of humanity.

Some came here by mistake.
Some came here voluntarily.
Some came here to forget.

There are no rules in Zero Ground.
No teams.
No salvation.

Only bullets.
Only walls.
Only you.

And the earth.

The ground that never forgets.
